# HA VPN Tunnel

I'm introducing modules here, to avoid code repetition.  To reiterate, this repository is to document how to create certain configurations on GCP.  This is by no means a tutorial on how to write Terraform modules.  I'm merely introducing them to reduce the amount of code I have to copy/paste.  The modules are not generic enough to be able to use them in a PRD environment, across different teams.
