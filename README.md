# Terraform research

This repository contains a number of scripts which have been used to investigate GCP installations.  They are not routinely updated, so a lot of them will probably be outdated.  However, it should give the reader an idea what to do, what resources were used and how they were configured.

## Scenarios
* [HA VPN](./ha_vpn_tunnel/)
* [DNS Hub and Spoke](./dns_hub_spoke)
* [Audit Sinks](./audit_sink)
* [VPC SC](./vpc_sc)
